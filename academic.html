    <h2>Fast Flashback—before the Spring Semester Starts</h2>
    Yo what’s up?

Time must have traveled at the speed of light because the Spring semester is around the corner. 
However, I feel that I still need more time to destress myself from last semester. Well, let me backtrack 
a little bit so that you can have a taste how crazy, challenging and cheerful college life is at Berkeley.

Why don’t we start with my schedule? I have (technically, had, but I wanna use the present tense to keep 
this article fresh and pleasant to read) Chemistry 1A at 9:00 AM (MWF),  followed by Philosophy 5 at 10:00 AM 
(MWF), and Math 1A at 1:00 PM (MWF). Clearly, there is a huge gap in between the last two classes because I 
decided to have at least a one-hour lunch break when I planned my schedule. Luckily, it turns out great and I 
encourage y’all to have a “mandatory” lunch or snack break to not only take a break between classes but also 
stop hasting, and you will enjoy the beautiful sunshine and engage more with your afternoon classes. Nevertheless, 
my UGBA C5 class only meets on Wednesdays from 11:00AM to 1:00 PM and I usually eat an apple and a croissant that I 
grabbed from the breakfast counter.

Tuesdays and Thursdays are a little bit different. Ideally, I’d like my Chemistry 1AL, aka the chemistry lab, on Tuesday
 because it is three-hour long and I have nothing to do in the morning. However, since I am on the wait-list, I do not 
 really have a choice but to enroll in the Thursday’s morning one, which starts at 8:00AM. Well, the schedule works fine 
 for the first couples of weeks until the lab becomes messy and our GSI does not dismiss the students on time. The delay 
 affects me because I do not have enough time to walk to my philosophy discussion session. That’s why sometimes I ditch 
 my discussion because it is really awkward for me to show up twenty minutes late when the session lasts only fifty minutes. 
 Moving forward, I have math discussion session from 12:30 PM to 2PM (TuThr). Yes, I have only half an hour on Thursday for lunch,
  which sucks for me: it takes me ten minutes to walk from Evans (the discussion building) to Golden Bear Cafe, ten minutes to get 
  food, and ten minutes to walk back to Evans. If you do your math right, you might ask when the hxck do I eat my lunch.

Introducing Berkeley Time: the one and only Ten-minute delay that is acceptable at UCB. For instance, on the schedule, my chemistry 
class starts at 9, but the professor does not begin lecturing until 9:10. Similarly, when friends ask you to have dinner at 6, it is 
acceptable for you to show up at most ten minutes late and they will not be mad at you. (Unless the person specifically states “No 
Berkeley Time”, usually for interview, workshop, symposium, etc, people assume the schedule runs on Berkeley Time).

Back to where I left off. So yeah, I have my lunch during Berkeley time and finish my meal after I took my math quiz, occasionally. 
There is also a chemistry discussion session after math discussion on Thursdays, but I often go to the professor’s office hour instead
 (I will elaborate more in another article entry). Last but not least, I go to chemistry lab lecture on Friday at 2:00PM, right after 
 my math lecture.

If you map all of my classes on a table, you will see a nice, imbalanced distribution that skewed to the left with my Monday-morning 
classes as outliers. You might also spot that my classes on average end at 2PM, so what do I do after that?

If you want to untangle your confusion, please wait for my following articles featuring gym exercise, library cramming, food and fun!

Have a great one (:

    <h2>First week = craziness</h2>
    Yo, what’s up?

As you all know, Berkeley students are back in town, and we are ready to rock & roll & drug & sex & party & cram & cry &…

Well, how did my life get crazy so rapidly (in the first week, for God’s sack)? I really don’t know. What I know is that I survived, and I have the chance to reiterate my struggles.

Way back in last semester, I decided to change my major to bioengineering, if possible, at some point of time during my sophomore year. This is a bold decision because it means I am switching from College of Letters and Science to College of Engineering, which has different degree requirements. Hence, I made a list of courses that I need to take so that I can adjust to these changes and increase my chance of successfully switching. Bottom line is, I need to have my first part of English reading class done by this semester so that I can take the second half during the summer.

Nevertheless, the reading classes at Cal are notoriously hard to enroll in. Even though I had a relatively early enrollment period, still I was #2 on the waitlist of a 17 people class. This is the Asian American Study R2A, a course that meets twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday from 11:00 to 12:30. However, the issue is that the department is not willing to raise the enrollment cap, meaning if the 17 people who are enrolled all stay, then I will not be able to get a seat. Therefore, for the first week of class, I went to class with anxiety because I hate uncertainty. My instructor kept on telling me to wait until someone else had dropped the class.

If there were alternatives, I would have been more relaxed. However, in reality, I hardly had a choice. First of all, all current reading classes were full, with a few exceptions that did not fit my schedule (my chem lab is 4-hour long from 8 to 12 on Monday, and most of the classes are MWF in the morning. Also, I have chem lecture and math discussion TuThr afternoon, so TuThr morning classes are my only shot). What’s worse, I need that 4-unit for my financial aid because at the moment I only had 10 units, which was not qualify for full Cal A grant T ^ T…As a result, I randomly shopped two classes to reach that 13-unit requirement. Nevertheless, there is a way in front of every mountain, I noticed that I could take English class at Berkeley City College and they could transfer my credit back to UC Berkeley. But the rub was, they denied my enrollment, stating that I already passed English 1A with my 3 in AP Lit. You bet I could use that score at UCB, but noooooo….Cal only takes 4 or higher.

Drowning in a stagnant pond is not the best way to die, so I determined to fight my fate. After talking to my instructor on Thursday, I wrote an e-mail to the department chair and asked him for a face-to-face meeting so that I could explain my situation and probably convinced him to raise the cap. Just to have a double warranty , I walked all the way to downtown Berkeley, where the city college is, to enroll in their English class because I knew the class starts on the following week and that class has only three seats left. Successfully enrolled in the class, I realized that I only have two minutes plus berkeley time to be on time for my chemistry class.

I shrunk a sixteen-minute walk down to twelve-minute…a 0.9 mile walk, uphill. Pain in the A spot, I know.

That’s not it. The most dramatic part was when I got back my dorm and started to share my epic story with my roommates while I was logging into my CalCentral (student center) website, I found myself an official enrolled student in the Asian American R2A. Of course, I was over the moon (twice :)) ! Imagine what my life would be if I were taking seven classes (six at Berkeley and one at city college) while having a ten-hour long job per week. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE

Anyway, thanks for sharing this insane journey with me, and I will begin my work-study job next week. Hopefully, it is less dramatic like this one.

Cheers

    <h2>Onward, Second Year!</h2>
    Yo, what’s up?

Hope y’all had a nice and relaxing summer. I know I haven’t updated anything for a long time, and I thank you for your patience and support.

Well, I went back to China for a month to reunite with my family and travelled with them. Then, I return to Berkeley to finish Physics 7A and the second half of reading and writing class. Both classes were fast-paced, but I enjoyed them a lot (campus had way fewer people, and I really missed that part). Even better, I received a letter of recommendation from that physics class, so I could include it to my change of college application.

Fast forward to this semester: craziness continues <: I am taking 18 units in total. Well, don’t be overwhelmed by that number, yet.

CS61A: Introduction to Python (MWF, also posted online) Units: 4

This is my one of my favorite classes so far at Berkeley. It is an intro class to computer science and programming using the language Python. The Instructor professor DeNero has been receiving all the teaching awards for the past few years. The class itself has more than 1850 students, 100+ teaching assistants, 40+academic interns, and numberless staffs and past students. I am spending most of my time coding for homework, lab, and project. In fact, I just finished my first project The Game of Hog this past Wednesday, and literally, it took me and my lab partner more than 40 hours for the past week working on it. It’s also fun because I was chosen to be the CS Scholar as a potential CS student. I am not sure if I can handle all the CS prerequisites yet, but so far I am enjoying all the resources from the CS department dedicated only to the CS scholar students. Nevertheless, midterm 1 is coming next week, so I am going to study right after I finish writing this post. If you are interested in what I am learning in class, please search cs61a.org on google.

BioE 10: Introduction to Biomedicine for Engineers (TuThr) Units:4

This is (also) one of my favorite classes so far at Berkeley. You might ask me why I am doing all the introduction courses. Well, since I am on the process of changing into Bioengineering, I need to fulfill the freshman curriculum before I move on, and this class happens to be the ones that are only offered during fall semester. Also, this class is super competitive to get in. I signed up during phase I of the class enrollment period and I was on the waitlist. Thank God I got off the waitlist pretty soon. Professor Johnson is one of the only three professors at UC Berkeley who has a 5 on Rate My Professor dot Com. We don’t have any exams for this class, and the lecture materials are easy to grasp. My friend told me to appreciate this class as a GPA booster because there aren’t many classes like this one in Berkeley.

Math 53: Multivariable Calculus (TuThr) Units:4

Ironically, my favorite class and my least favorite class are all on the same day, back to back. It’s not hard to tell that this math class is my least favorite. Beware that I still use the word “favorite” because professor Sethian is such a cool lecturer. I am just not content about the speed in which he teaches during class(no time to write down notes, and he will not provide a pdf version of the notes until a day or two later). More importantly, he gave a shxt ton of homework. For the first week of school, we had 35 questions (due in two days). For the second week of school (including the Labor Day weekend), we had 115 questions. Tell you the truth, since I had been working on the CS project, I was behind in this class…hopefully, I can pick it up soon. By the way, if you ever learned about level surface and wonder who came up with this idea of expression multiple dimensional space in a single dimensional space, you should go talk to Sethian (he received the highest award for applied math on this theory).

UGBA 39AC: History of Philanthropy (Thr) Units: 3

Have you ever asked yourself: what is Philanthropy? Is it the money that only rich people give to the public? Is it what churches and non-profits are doing? How do different cultures practice philanthropy? Do they have the same giving traditions as the US? Well, in this class, professor Perez and professor Lacon will lead you to explore different sectors of philanthropy. Personally, I really enjoy the class not only because the professors are cool but also the questions they have to initiate the reflections and conversations really affirm and challenge my perspectives on philanthropy, the love for human beings. This class counts as the American culture breadth that every student in Berkeley has to fulfill, and it is also very competitive to get in (18 seats, reserved for freshman and sophomore only).

4+4+4+3 is 15. How come I said 18 at the beginning… Yes I can count. Let me continue listing my classes.

BioE 26: Intro to Bioengineering (Wed) Unit: 1

Since this is a seminar-based class, it has only one unit. We meet once a week and we listen to presenters from different aspects of bioengineering to talk about their backgrounds and what projects/companies they currently work at. Prof. Luke presents for the first two lectures about his research on small analytical medical devices.

CS 36: CS Scholar Seminar (M) Unit:2

This is also a seminar class, but only for CS Scholars. If you wanna learn more about what CS Scholar is, visit this website https://eecs.berkeley.edu/cs-scholars And if you see my face on the group picture, great! That means you are on the right page. Anyway, we only met once for this class, so I am not sure what we will do. Maybe Christopher, our instructor, will invite different professor to talk to us and present the amazing things computer scientists do out there in the world. But for me, I just curious about how to get an internship at Google or Apple, if I survive my intro CS class haha.

So that’s it for my classes. Since I am on a tight schedule, I am not sure when I will update again, but there are so many more things I wanna share with you all. So, definitely stay on tune, and I will return sooner than you expected, hopefully.

See ya!
