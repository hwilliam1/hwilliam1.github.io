        <h2>Early Bear, Early Start</h2>
        
Yo, what’s up?

It’s never too late for Berkeley students to complain how early their summer break ends. 
While other UC’s don’t start school until late September, Berkeley misses the students so 
much that the semester begins in mid-August. Interestingly, when Berkeley students go off 
for a one-month winter break and a summer vacation in the middle of May, not a single person 
complains how “unfair” these dates are. Well, even though we have two eyes, we can only see half 
of the picture. I will elaborate on this idea later.

But this is not my point.

As an incoming freshman, I moved in to my dorm a week earlier because Berkeley had prepared something 
truly transcendental, something that had never done in the history of Cal (official nickname of UC Berkeley, 
which is also a more commonly used abbreviation than UCB): The Golden Bear Orientation, a week-long orientation 
on campus that means to apprise students about Cal’s culture (and sell football season pass), to acknowledge 
students that they have made the right choice coming to Cal (the number one public university in the world, only 
to be surpassed by UCLA in the second week of school), and to pump-up students’ spirits to face the upcoming challenges 
(over-crowded lower division classes, GPA caps, sexual herassments, armed robberies, peaceful protests, not enough or too 
much meal points, etc).

However, I gained something more valuable from the orientation: friendships. I was in group 140 and we were the Cactus group 
with two amazing GBO leaders. As a group, we went laser tag shooting, went to Mission District in SF, visited BAMFA museum, 
and so much more. Up to this day, I still keep in touch with most of my group friends, and we usually sit together when we meet 
at Crossroads, the closest dining hall to my dorm.

Overall, I gave GBO an 8 out of 10 rating because of the rewarding experience that I had, and I felt I would not be as ready as 
I was had I jumped right into the intense study and competition. GBO encouraged me to think outside of Berkeley’s academic compass 
and to navigate my own route. As a wise man once said, “you are on the right ship, and now the wheel is in your hand, captain.”

Until next time,

    <h2>After class and all the Jazz</h2>
    Yo what’s up?

    I assume many of you want to know what I did after all my classes, so that’s what I am gonna talk about now.
    
    Option #1: Gym exercise. “The club isn’t the best place to find a lover So the gym is where I go”—yes, I modified the lyrics to fit the situation. Anyway, Berkeley has three gyms and undergrad students have the access to all of them (any UC students can freely use them too, as long as they fill out a form). Fun story: when Kamote came visit me, we went to the gym together, but the gym staff stopped Kamote because K wanted to enter the gate with K’s UCD student ID…Lmao. Back to the topic. The gym has a nickname called RSF, which stands for Recreational Sports Facility. When people mention RSF, they usually refer to the largest one on Bancroft street (I will include a map of Berkeley somewhere on The Talking Kamotes haha after I figured out how).  The one I use the most, however, is the one under the California Memorial Stadium because it is the closest to the bioengineering building where my math class is and the closest to my dorm. Inside RSF, there is nothing surprising, except the massage chairs (they are one of the best destressing tools at Cal. Professors also teach martial arts such as Judo, Taekwondo, and Jiu-Jitsu at RSF. Moreover, some fairs like career fair, Cal Day, Caltopia have held annually at RSF’s field house. What’s more impressive, the RSF is also one of the exam places for Chem 1A final last semester. Just picture yourself sitting with the other 999 students at the gym and how incredible is that? (Luckily, I took mine at Lewis Hall with 99ish other students).
    
    Option #2: Library study. Cal is famous for not only its library size but also its underground library system. With 18 subject libraries and 10 affiliated libraries, Cal holds more than 10,000,000 books and 70,000 serials *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley_Libraries. Doe Library is probably the most famous one and it is often a great place to take graduation pictures or just touring pictures. I am proud to announce that I have been to all undergraduate libraries (there are libraries for graduate students, like the Law Library), and my top choices when comes to study are: Anthropology Library, Bioscience & Natural Resource Library, Business Library, Main Stacks, and Moffit Library, in alphabetical order). Personally, I love to use Mac desktops at Moffit and some of these libraries offer free MacBook for students to check out for at most two-week long! Additionally, the study rooms at these libraries are a good place for students to collaborate. I do not recall how many times I have booked a room and gather my friends to study chemistry at Moffit and it is quite helpful to use the whiteboard to explain the complicated molecular orbital theory. I also make weekly report videos for the business class with my co-founders at one of the study rooms. Libraries are just beyond amazing, y’all. Use them wisely > v <
    
    Option #3: Miscellaneous kinds of stuff. Really, there is so much to do at Cal. I can wander around the campus and sneak into a wide variety of lectures that I am not enrolled in; I can take a nap at different nap pod stations to recharge myself; I can sign up for a social science research study, do a fun little experiment, and get paid for it (I earn around $200 in just three months, almost feel like having a part-time job). What’s more, I can go back to my residence hall and play the piano at either the academic center or the main lounge. During the summer, I order free, home-delivered boba from Sharetea; during the winter, if time is correct, I go up the Campanile and watch the sun kisses the Golden Gate Bridge and submerges in the Bay.
    
    Nevertheless, loneliness does catch up with me eventually.
    
    That’s why I am going to participate in different clubs and De-Cal’s (student-teach classes) in the upcoming semester, and I hope I can find the right group of people for support and companion.
    
    See you soon!

    <h2>As Long As the Rivers Flow, the Grass shall Grow———A Brief Comment on Mental Health</h2>
    Frankly, mental health has always been a topic that I am interested yet reluctant to write about, not only because I am the least qualified person to give advise (even though I took a psychology course in high school) but also because I have my own problems and often time afraid of opening up to seek help from others. Nevertheless, I determine to write this piece because my ex girlfriend just texted me two days ago.

Before I jump into all the drama, let me answer some questions that you readers might have about Berkeley. Some students asked me during the AVID Junior Field Trip about Cal’s high depression rate and if the mysteries about college suicide were true. Unfortunately, they are. There are several reasons that may provoke people to end their lives this way: rising house rents, stuck on a thesis for graduation, high competition in nearly everything and feel like the whole world is against themselves. But remember, committing suicide is NEVER EVER the solution to ANYTHING! As long as you are still alive, there will be people who can help you find your way out. There are psychologists in Tang Center who will listen to your struggles and provide you with the most helpful resources that you need; there are students in different clubs who might share the same struggles with you but support you because they understand you better than your professors; there are your family members who, no matter where you are, will always be trustworthy and on your side.

However, what troubled me the most during my Spring semester was more like an emotional panic, and it all started with a relationship crisis.

Well, it’s not quite accurate to call this girl who I had been pursued for the past three almost four years my “girlfriend” because I never had a date with her before she told me that she was not ready to date, but we were closer than friends…anyway, the point is we kept in touch even after I flew to Berkeley, and just like the year before, she invited me to celebrate Christmas with her and her family, deliberately, I agreed. But the party did not occur, at least not with me, and we “broke up” again, just like two years ago…that’s another story which I failed to erase and has to go with me to my grave.

Long story short, I was empty by the time I returned Berkeley. In the first three weeks, I had nightmares and my roommate had to wake me up in the middle of the night to check if I am okay. Like a fox, I replied, “Nothing, I am fine.” I hoped that my new job would suck away my leisure time so that I had no time to remember her and the memorable moments that we shared together, little had I knew that it not only did not work this way but also made the situation worse. Spending 10 hours on work means that I needed to find 10 hours elsewhere to catch up my homework, and often time I was so tired but my brain was still running, making it more difficult for me to fall asleep. On one of those nights, I always wondered why: why would she cancel all the plans we made during the year, why would she refuse to start a relationship with me, why would she lie to me. Why? Nights by nights I realized that not everything must to have an answer, not a satisfied one at least. I lowered my pride and tired to step in her shoes to go through the situation, surprisingly, I found out that she was right: this relationship will not work, and there is no unless. Also, I learned that I, too, sometimes speak lies in order to prevent the truth from hurting others, but when other people lie to me I usually neglect the kindness behind their motivations. Not anymore, I spoke to myself. Staring at the flowers through a misty glass can be a bliss.

When I noticed that I was equally sad before and after the broke-up, I realized that I made a right choice to move on. Amidst all the internal turbulence, I was facing challenging topics such as synthesis questions in organic chemistry, and power series in calculus. Honestly, I was on the verge of mental break down. Luckily, I have Kamote and Camote as my dearest friends. I completely opened up when we talked multiple times through the phone, and three of us reunited at Davis during the past spring break to relax, to enlighten each other, and to seek the beauty in nature and forget the cruel, ugly, hungry world for a brief moment. I opened up to my roommates and floormates as well, and they suggest me widen my horizon and move on. Dining out and having field trips with them really pull me out of the dark whirl pool and put a stop-sign on my way to a lonely and dangerous dead beach end.

Since then, I focused on more what I had and what I could do. I quit my job, but I decided to join a dance team next semester so that I could meet more people. I tried to ask a pretty girl from my writing class to have ice cream together, and even though she rejected the offer (she is seeing someone right now) I was still happy because I got an A- in that class (all the readings that I did, trying to impress her, paid off). So on and so on.

The cure to mental health issues contains a large percentage of self-reflecting and self-understanding, but also contains a percentage of outside advising which is quite crucial for you to end your loop of negative thoughts and pick up your shxt again. “As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow

As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow”. An old song, but the lyrics is still wise.
