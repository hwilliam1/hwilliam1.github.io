            <h2>Truth or Dare: All the Myths and True Things About Living On-Campus</h2>
            Yo, what’s up?

            Ever since I have become a Cal student, people started to ask me questions like how is college life different from high school life, how is the food in the dining halls, how is the living environment, etc. Because of that, I feel the necessity to write this post to address some misconceptions people may have and affirm some overheard stories specific to living in Cal.
            
            Myth#1: You should live off-campus to save money
            
            Although the statement is 100% inaccurate for everyone, it is not applicable to most of the first-year students and here is why. First of all, if you receive any financial aid, Cal distributes more aid to on-campus students than off-campus students. I have spoken with my financial aid advisor, and she told me that if I live off-campus, there would be a $4,000 cut from my total aid package. Secondly, for first-year students, the rent for residence halls covers the meal points (a minimum of 1,500 points) for dining halls, the university-owned cafes and bear-markets, and the students can safe money if they eat at the dining halls for a discounted price (6 points for breakfast, 7 points for lunch/brunch, 8 points for dinner) instead of dining out for each meal ($8~$9 per entry, plus taxes and tips). Thirdly, you save your money from commuting because the residence halls are right there next to the campus. Although Berkeley students have unlimited bus passes built into there cost-of-living package, not all the students who live off-campus have a place conveniently located next to a bus stop, and there might be extra Uber fee in their monthly budget for commuting. Conclusion: Busted.
            
            Myth#2: You cannot trust anyone from your floor because you don’t know them well
            
            I have lived in the 5th floor of Freeborn Hall for almost a year now, and for me I trust my floor mates to a larger extent that I can leave my room door open and take a shower for half an hour without concerning any of them will break in and steal my stuffs. Mutual trust takes time to develop, and I usually take the initiative whenever I can in a brand new environment. In the first couple of weeks, I learned everybody’s name of my floor and remembered which room they are in and whom their roommates are. Over the course of time, I dined out with them, solved homework questions with them, travelled to San Francisco with them, and together we shared many memorable moments. With that being said, it is the outsider who I concern about more. Earlier this semester, a stranger somehow tailgated into our building, miraculously went to our floor through the elevator (we need to use our ID not only to enter the building but also to activate the elevator), and stole one of my floor mates’s laptop while the person was at the bathroom. Although the UC Police Department had a footage of the suspect’s face, the police never caught the person and the laptop never returned home. On the sad note, I lent my computer to my floor mate so that the person could continue doing the work while the new laptop was on the way. If I didn’t trust the person, I would not lend anything out. Moving out next year, I think the nurturing, supporting academic environment is the most valuable aspect of the on-campus housing experience that I had in which I would miss the most. Conclusion: Busted
            
            Truth#1: Berkeley is a huge Pot-ty
            
            People smoke here, a lot, period.
            
            Not just the common ones like cigarettes or marijuana, but also bacons, sausages, salmons, etc. Even though the UC Berkeley campus is tobacco free, when you visit here you can still see people smoking merely outside the school and/or city smoking range. Anywhere, anytime, anyone can vape during the day and it is up to you if you want to joint (see the pun? Haha). When I applied to on-campus housing, I specifically chose to live in Freeborn to enjoy the substance-free environment. Although my friends told me that nobody smokes in their buildings, Freeborn is the only residence hall that the policy on substance is strongly reinforced. Nevertheless, rules are made by people and people are full of flaws. Ironically, two of my floor mates enjoy to vape at night, and they have not been kicked out yet (another example showing how nice and tolerant people in my floor are) because they clean the air up once they are done, which is an uncommon move in other residence halls. Conclusion: Confirmed
            
            Truth#2: Food in dining halls sucks
            
            Yes, home food is always the best, and dining hall food is horrible…not always though. Here at Berkeley we have four dining commons: Cafe 3, Crossroads, Clark Kerr, and Foothill, and they are all semi-buffet style. Clark Kerr is the furthest from campus, so not many students go unless they are the ones who live there. Foothill is a wild card. Sometimes they have very savory food such as curry beef stew, pho bowls, mashed potatoes, orange chicken, and so forth. But sometimes they just have cheese sticks, sandwich, bread, and more food with cheese. In my opinion, Cafe 3 is the best of them all, but its reputation is somehow ruined and people referred it as the “dining common for vegetarians”. Indeed, they have many vegetarian-friendly options, but that doesn’t mean they only serve vegetarian food. They have lean beef, teriyaki chicken, sushi bowls, egg omelet, smoked salmon, and so forth, plus, it is close to campus. Crossroads, in fact, is the one most of people complain about. If you cannot image how bad your broccoli can taste, how little pieces of clam you can get from a bowl of clam chowder, or ice cream machines that never work during the summer but are always working during the winter, well, Crossroads is the place you need to go to seek the answers (once is enough to realize how mediocre or terrible it is). Nevertheless, if you go to the same dining hall everyday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, I am confident that you will get tired of the food in no more than two weeks. That’s why I prefer to switch places to eat to have the temporary satisfaction of the dining hall food. An alternative way to enjoy dining hall food is to wait until you are super hungry so that you will eat whatever they offer you. But I know a even better choice: dining with your friends so that you all can socialize with one another while complaining about how bad the food is. Conclusion: Confirmed

            Have a nice spring break!

            <h2>Work work</h2>
            Yo, what’s up?

            I am finally done with finals and have spare time to post on the blog site. I miss writing to you all.

            This semester, I have to admit, was far more intense and time-consuming than the first one. Besides taking monster classes like organic chemistry and the 4-hour Monday labs, I also participated in Bioprinting DeCal (a student-taught one unit pass/no pass class), which had one hour lecture on Tuesday night and one two-hour lab on Wednesday night.

            However, the greatest time-cut came from my job.

            Towards the end of my first semester, I was looking for my first job. Originally, I planned to work at the residential hall, but after I have seen the time commitment (up to 40 hours per week) I changed my mind. So instead, I applied to work as a lab administrative assistant in an on-campus lab and I was lucky enough to got in.

            My first day of work did not start right away because of some paperwork that needs to be done (turns out the lab only pays half of my hourly salary. The rest comes from the federal work-study program). Hence, I waited until Spring semester to work there. I won’t mention the specific name of the lab, but it’s in a building northwest of the campus, forming a diagonal route from my dorm. My schedule could be quite flexible so long I have worked at least 10 hours per day, so I chose to work four hours on Wednesdays and six hours on Fridays (since I only had one math lecture to go to on Fridays). Overall, it was a pretty chill job: I made online searches of what the professor and the research teams want to purchase, listed all the specifications for approval, and then created a spreadsheet contains all the details of the purchasing items. Sometimes, in order to maximize my productivity and not to make me bored, my manager would assigned me different tasks, such as reorganizing the Nature and Sciencemagazines, dusting the shelves, and photocopying the documents. It was not until the flight searches and the funding checks did the job drove me crazy. Basically, the professor was so meticulous that he wants to make sure that he got the best deal he could get. To confirm, I needed to search flights by different companies, open-jaw lines, or even combinations along with other transportations to prove that there are any cheaper tickets. Because the price fluctuates everyday, I had to update the document by repeating the routine over and over again until the professor has made up his mind. And when my manager told me that the professor had already bought the ticket and it was quite cheap (less than a thousand for a transcontinental business class flight), I was pissed off—-how am I supposed to find a ticket cheaper than that, and most of all, why am I still working here, to waste my precious time? Hell no!

            Therefore, I quit my job two weeks before the semester ended. I used my earnings to purchase a new laptop and saved up the remaining money for future rent. My roommate asked me if I regret my decision, but I directly reply him, “No.” I did not want to waste time on a job that’s tedious and did not improve me as a person. One might argue that most of the jobs are like that, but for me, I was just not ready to settle down. After all, like I mentioned in my letter of resignation, I am(will be) a scientist. I’d like to work with the professor, not work for him.

            See ya!
