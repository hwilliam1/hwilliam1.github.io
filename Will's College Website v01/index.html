        Yo, what's up?

        I am the new member Quamote, and I am thrilled toÂ be part of this 
        amazing journal keeping journey with my best friends Kamote and Camote (:
        
        When The Talking Kamotes first published about a year ago, 
        I became a fan of it in no time: the lively languages, 
        the insightful first-hand views, and the useful lessons on college lives captured my eyes 
        and settled down so many questions that I had when I was still a graduating high school senior. 
        Hence, when Kamote and Camote invited me this year to join their team, I gave my solid "yes, of course," 
        immediately.
        
        I hope that my tips and opinions can be helpful to the readers, 
        and I also hope that I can keep up Kamote and Camote's high writing level while providing informative 
        and entertaining stories.
